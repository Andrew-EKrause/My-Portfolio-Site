## Description
**_Portfolio Website to Showcase my Skills_** <br/>
This project is published on the world wide web through GitHub Pages and Google Domains. I designed the portfolio site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I created the website to demonstrate my knowledge in web design as well as list my skills in Computer Science. The portfolio website contains four main pages: A home page, a resume page, a projects page, and a contact information page. Each page contains unique information about my skills, certifications, and educational background. An important feature in this project is responsiveness to different screen sizes. The portfolio site can be viewed on both mobile devices and desktop computers. Future updates on the project will include different typefaces, additional responsive behavior, and new personal projects added to the "projects" page.
